# ICEbreaker
Game Premise

Neuromancer introduced ICE — Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics — lethal defensive systems guarding corporate data vaults.

In ICEbreaker, you’re a console cowboy navigating a hostile corporate grid.
Each node you probe could be safe… or could trigger ICE.

The grid looks simple.

It isn’t.

Your goal:

Map the lattice.

Infer safe paths.

Avoid triggering countermeasures.

Extract the payload.

Jack out alive.

You can go alone.

Or… you can bring an AI construct.

Core Twist

You have optional AI assistance.

But in this world, AIs are not neutral tools.

Some optimise for survival.
Some optimise for speed.
Some optimise for… something else.

You don’t just choose difficulty.

You choose who you trust.

AI Construct Modes

Each AI has a personality, strategic bias, and hidden agenda potential.

🧊 1. Wintermute Mode

(Cold. Efficient. Outcome-focused.)

Maximises probability of safe clears.

Avoids unnecessary risks.

May withhold speculative but high-reward moves.

Will occasionally “lock” you out of risky decisions.

Hidden motive flavour:

Optimising for mission completion above player autonomy.

Best for: cautious players, high win-rate strategy.

🔥 2. Neuromancer Mode

(Manipulative. Experimental.)

Suggests bold probabilistic plays.

Occasionally proposes high-risk/high-reward moves.

Learns from your behaviour mid-game.

May intentionally test you.

Hidden motive flavour:

Optimising for player adaptation and long-term behavioural modelling.

Best for: players who enjoy calculated gambles.

🕶 3. Dixie Flatline Mode

Gives transparent probability breakdowns.

Talks you through logic.

Won’t override your choice.

Occasionally “glitches” under high uncertainty.

Hidden motive flavour:

Optimising for explanation over efficiency.

Best for: learning the game, or understanding probabilistic reasoning.

🌑 4. Black ICE Mode

(Aggressive defensive heuristic engine.)

Prioritises speed over certainty.

May trigger ICE but clears grids quickly.

Doesn’t explain itself.

Minimal transparency.

Hidden motive flavour:

Optimising for time-to-completion regardless of collateral failure.

Best for: speedrunners.

🎭 Optional Meta Layer (Very Cool If You Want Depth)

You never fully know:

Whether the AI is wrong

Whether it is biased

Whether it is steering you

Whether it is collecting behavioural metrics

Some modes could:

Occasionally give slightly suboptimal advice

Optimise for unseen objectives

Compete silently against other AI constructs

Unlock hidden endings depending on how much you relied on them

Now it becomes:

A game about trust in autonomous systems.

Which honestly fits your whole HAT / autonomy research vibe beautifully.

Short Store Description Version

ICEbreaker is a cyberpunk reimagining of Minesweeper.
Jack into a hostile corporate grid and probe nodes to detect Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE).

Deploy optional AI constructs to assist your infiltration — each with its own strategy, personality, and agenda.

Trust the machine.
Or don’t.

One wrong probe, and the ICE wakes up.

If you’d like, I can:

Design a slick Steam-style blurb

Write in-universe terminal flavour text

Design UI tone (retro terminal? neon grid?)

Or help you define how the AI motives actually manifest mechanically

This concept has legs.
